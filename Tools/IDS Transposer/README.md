# IDS Transposer  

The IDS Transposer converts data in rectangular files into the five standard IDS files (INDIVIDUAL, INDIV_INDIV, CONTEXT, INDIV_CONTEXT, CONTEXT_CONTEXT).  Input and output files may be either comma or tab delimited text files.   

Details of the conversion process are explained in the User Guide provided here, which was published as Klancher Merchant & Alter. (2017). *IDS Transposer: A Users Guide Historical Life Course Studies*, 4, 59-96. http://hdl.handle.net/10622/23526343-2017-0004?locatt=view:master   
   
Two versions of the Java code for the IDS Transposer are provided:

- Desktop   
The Desktop version includes both Java code and a .JAR file for installation on a PC.  It also allows batch files, which are very useful when the source data files are revised.

- Web service   
IDS was originally provided as a web service from servers at ICPSR.  This web service is no longer available, but the Java code provided here can be used to implement the same service in other places.
